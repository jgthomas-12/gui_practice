I built these two scripts as GUI practice so I could, in turn, build a simple automation for a project I'm working on.

### To run:

1. Ensure Python has been installed ([Python] (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3123/))

2. From the command line run `python gui_mp3.py1` or `python gui_practice.py`
